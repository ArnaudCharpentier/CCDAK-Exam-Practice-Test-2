When is the onCompletion() method called?

private class ProducerCallback implements Callback {
         @Override
        public void onCompletion(RecordMetadata recordMetadata, Exception e) {
         if (e != null) {
             e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } 
}
 
    ProducerRecord<String, String> record =
            new ProducerRecord<>("topic1", "key1", "value1");
    producer.send(record, new ProducerCallback()); 


1. When send() method is  called 
2. When message is serialized successfully
3. when the broker response is received
