A producer application in a developer machine was able to send messages to a Kafka topic. 
After copying the producer application into another developer's machine, 
the producer is able to connect to Kafka but unable to produce to the same Kafka topic because of an authorization issue.
What is the likely issue?

1. The kafka broker needs to be rebooted
2. The Kafka ACL does not allow another machine IP.
3. Broker configurations needs to be changed to allow a diffrent producer
